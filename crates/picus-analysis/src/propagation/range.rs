//! Per-wire range constraints shared by every propagation lemma.
//!
//! Lemmas read and write `ctx.ranges` keyed by wire index. The DPVL
//! driver seeds the map with [`initial_ranges`] before the first
//! propagation pass; lemmas tighten entries as they fire (e.g.
//! `binary01` pins a wire to `{0, 1}`, `basis2` propagates known
//! bits).
//!
//! `RangeValue` lives in this module rather than alongside any
//! single lemma so adding a new range-aware lemma does not require
//! reaching into another lemma's file or coupling consumers to a
//! particular producer.
//!
//! Soundness invariant for producers (copy-awareness). A range is keyed
//! by **wire**, and a consumer that promotes a wire to *known* from its
//! range — aboz via [`RangeValue::excludes_zero`], binary01 via
//! [`RangeValue::is_singleton`] — relies on the recorded constraint
//! holding in **every** satisfying witness, i.e. for both DPVL copies
//! `x_w` and `y_w`. The two existing producers are copy-safe by
//! construction: wire 0 is pinned to `1` in both copies, and binary01's
//! `{0, 1}` comes from a `w·(w-1)=0` equality the lowering emits for both
//! copies (input wires reuse `x_w`, so the fact holds trivially for both).
//! A new producer that records a range from a fact true of only one copy
//! would let those consumers promote a wire that is not actually
//! determined — a false "safe" verdict. Establish the fact over both
//! copies before inserting.
