//! Propagation lemma plugin interface.
//!
//! Each lemma lives in its own file under `propagation/`, implements
//! [`PropagationLemma`], and submits a [`LemmaDescriptor`] via
//! `inventory::submit!`. The DPVL outer loop discovers descriptors from
//! the inventory registry, instantiates the lemmas selected by the
//! caller's [`crate::dpvl::LemmaSet`], and runs them to a fixed point.
//!
//! Contract:
//! - `run` is called once per outer iteration with a read-only view of
//!   the IR and a mutable [`PropagationCtx`]. The lemma returns `true`
//!   iff it learned something this call (added a known signal,
//!   tightened a range, pushed an equality, or pushed a disjunction).
//! - Constraints pushed to `ctx.learned` (and disjunctions pushed to
//!   `ctx.learned_disjunctions`) are folded into the IR only at the
//!   *end* of an outer iteration, so within a single iteration every
//!   lemma sees the same IR snapshot. Inter-lemma ordering is
//!   therefore irrelevant: the next iteration begins with everyone's
//!   learned facts merged.
//! - Lemmas may carry per-run state on `&mut self` (e.g. caches built
//!   on the first call). Each lemma instance is fresh per DPVL run.
//!   Caches indexed by polynomial position should invalidate when
//!   `ir.equalities.len()` grows — the DPVL driver appends to that
//!   vector after every iteration.
