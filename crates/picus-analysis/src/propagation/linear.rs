//! Linear propagation lemma — derives a wire from a set of "if these
//! are known, this one is forced" implications.
//!
//! For each polynomial constraint `p = 0`, partition the variables that
//! actually appear into linear-only (every term containing them has
//! total degree 1) and nonlinear (appear in at least one term of total
//! degree ≥ 2). A purely-linear variable `v` can be eliminated as soon
//! as every other variable in `p` is known, so the implication
//! `deps(p, v) → wire(v)` is recorded. The lemma applies the implications
//! to a fixed point each iteration.
//!
//! Wire-keyed: promoting a wire to known relies on the matched constraint
//! being mirrored in both copies (the copy-symmetry invariant documented
//! in `picus_analysis::uniqueness::r1cs_to_uniqueness_query`).
