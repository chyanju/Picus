//! UNSAT core tracing via Buchberger observer hooks.
//!
//! Hooks into the [`BuchbergerObserver`] callbacks to build a polynomial
//! dependency DAG, then BFS-traces from a target basis element back to
//! the original input polynomials responsible for it.
//!
//! Each basis element maintains the set of original input indices it
//! transitively depends on. When the GB is trivial (contains a
//! constant), the dependency set of that constant is the UNSAT core.
