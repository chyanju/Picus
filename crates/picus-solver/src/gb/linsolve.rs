//! Linear (Gaussian) pre-elimination — the in-tree analogue of cvc5's
//! `theory/ff/gauss.cpp`.
//!
//! The split-GB layout shares a polynomial into partition 1 (full)
//! only when it is linear AND has `<= 2` terms (`split_gb::admit`), so a
//! multi-term linear relation such as `x = a·y + b·z + c` never reaches
//! the nonlinear reasoning — its eliminations are stranded in partition 0.
//! This pass closes that gap: it computes a Gröbner basis of the linear
//! subsystem (for a linear ideal this is Gaussian elimination — a reduced
//! row echelon form) and reduces every nonlinear generator modulo it, so
//! the pivot variables are substituted out before split-GB runs.
//!
//! Soundness: the linear GB `L` generates the same ideal as the linear
//! inputs, and each nonlinear `p` is replaced by its normal form
//! `p mod L`, with `p ≡ (p mod L)` modulo `L`. Hence
//! `{L} ∪ {p mod L : p nonlinear}` and the original system define the
//! same variety over any prime field — a model of one is a model of the
//! other. (The caller still verifies any SAT model against the original
//! polynomials.) Linear inconsistency (`1 ∈ L`) is reported directly.
