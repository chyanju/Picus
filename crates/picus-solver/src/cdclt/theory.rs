//! Theory plug-in interface for CDCL(T).
//!
//! Shape matches cvc5's `Theory` virtual class:
//! the SAT engine calls [`Theory::notify_fact`] on every committed literal
//! and [`Theory::post_check`] at a candidate full assignment. The theory
//! returns `Sat` / `Unsat(core)` / `Unknown`; the orchestrator turns the
//! core into a SAT lemma.
//!
//! [`propagate`] defaults to no propagation and [`explain`] to a panic;
//! the FF theory overrides both.
