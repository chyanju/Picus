//! Incremental Buchberger driver with push / pop checkpointing.
//!
//! Wraps [`super::BuchbergerState`] to provide:
//!   * `add_generators` / `add_generators_observed` — extend the GB by
//!     reducing new polynomials against the current basis.
//!   * `push` / `pop` — DFS-style backtracking via a `Checkpoint` trail.
//!   * `run_only` / `set_cancel_token` — resume an in-flight build with
//!     a fresh cancel budget across solve-call boundaries.
